I hadn't updated my blog in a while because it was a terribly painful process
and if I made even the slightest mistake I would have to go through the entire
thing again and then wait for it to build. Then it would sometimes build and
sometimes not build. Very very frustrating.

Enter: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

I thought I'd give it a try and wow I was really impressed. I created a new
repository with my theme & posts, pointed my new Netlify account at it, told
it it was rendered with Hugo, registered a new domain, and was off and running
with SSL in about ten minutes.

Exceptionally cool.
