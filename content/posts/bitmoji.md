I've been using the [Bitmoji app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitstrips.imoji&hl=en) on my phone for a while now and it's been great
for getting across that little something extra during all that fun text-based
communication. But that's the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Once you've created
your very own bitmoji in your likeness, there is a Chrome plugin that lets you
conjure one and shove it into your clipboard whenever you're feeling froggy.

They come in handy in work emails, blog posts, forum posts, and just about
anywhere you might want to paste something fun. Then there's the application
in GitHub issues! Is someone being extra awesome? Give them a virtual high-five
with your very own bitmoji that gets cleverly converted to the appropriate
markup:

So head over there, create your own bitmoji, and get to posting that stuff all
over the place. You'll be glad you did and your colleagues will love you for it,
guaranteed. Or your money back. But maybe not.
