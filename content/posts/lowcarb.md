It's about that time again. I'm making another push to lose weight after
my drop from 475 down to 420. Thanks to
[@snipeyhead](https://twitter.com/snipeyhead) for the nudge in this tweet.
She's a constant source of awesome on my virtual island.

She pointed me to
[this article](https://steemit.com/keto/@snipe/kickstarting-keto-tips-and-recipes-to-help-you-keep-calm-and-keto-on)
where she talked about her first few months doing a Keto diet and after
going through it I got myself a one-year subscription for the
[Lifesum](https://lifesum.com/) application and started tracking everything.

The results so far:

- Water intake is above their recommended daily.
  - It was previously almost zero.
- I've gone with the "Keto Easy" diet initially which caps at 100g of carbs.
- I was 41g over, then 22g over, and yesterday 19g over.

I'm not feeling yucky (yet) but I'm excited to be moving in a good direction.
