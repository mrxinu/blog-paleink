When I was just starting out in the late 90s I read and tinkered as much as I
could but there just wasn't enough for me to do. I needed to learn faster. Then
I happened onto `#linuxhelp` on Efnet IRC (the original chat for you whipper
snappers).

Here I found a constant stream 24/7 of people with bugs, error messages, and
various problems that they needed a hand with. I started by answering the easy
questions and I read every line of every solution offered by the more seasoned
helpers. I'd take notes. I'd try things that they suggested on my own test
systems to cement the concepts. I'd read every article they linked.
