For my wife's birthday we went to a place called Urban Float.
We'd never been before but we'd seen the place and watched some videos on YouTube.
The bit before and after were the usual routine like you'd find if you were getting a massage.
There's a "quiet room" that you can relax in beforehand and afterward and the usual new age-y music playing.
The videos showed an actual room with dimmed lights and I want to say some kind of fire place, but this particular location was smaller and the place where you relaxed before your float was literally 4 chairs on the other side of a counter just past where you sign in.
The natural light from outside the building washes in through the windows.
They took us into one of the float rooms and gave us a tour of the amenities.
The pods themselves look like huge alien eggs with blue lights inside.
The floor was made of a short carpet that did really well when I came out of the shower with wet feet.
The shower had shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and vinegar.
They told us how the controls inside the pod worked.
One of them turned the light on and off and we were told that pressing it again was supposed to cycle through the colors and press again to stop the color on the one that we wanted.
When I tried doing it I turned the light off and then back on.
And then off and then back on again.
It didn't occur to me to push it once and that is probably what would have worked.
I got into the pod and immediately my feet popped out of the water and I was on my back and floating.
That's when I relaized that I wasn't going to be able to reach the handle in the pod to pull it down.
So there I was, floating in an open pod with the lights on.
I tried to put my feet down but tha tdidn't work out.
I finally worked out that I had to turn over (still floating) and put my knees under me to make contact with the floor.
I stood up, grabbed the handle, and got all the way back down into the water.
Laying back in the water was very strange.
There was a pool noodle that looked like it had been cut down shorter than the usual noodle you'd find in a pool.
I put the noodle behind my neck and I liked the way it supported my head.
There was a little floaty halo thing that was on a hook insid ethe pod too.
