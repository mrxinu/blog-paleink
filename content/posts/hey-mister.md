So I'm sitting at a table next to the downstairs play area for small kiddos with
Mackenzie sitting on one knee. To my left are two young men sitting across from
each other in a pair of chairs. A young lady came over to their table with
treats in each hand. There was no chair set aside for her.

"Where am I supposed to sit?" she asked.

Hooking a thumb behind him the boy furtherst from me said, "uh, go get a
chair..."

She sighs, puts down the desserts in her hands and goes to get a chair. I wasn't
paying attention after that but two of them went back to the Cinnabon and came
back and sat down again. That's when this bit of conversation caught my
attention.

"Hey mister... can I ask you a question?"

"Sure."

"What do you do when a girl really pisses you off?"

"Well it would depend on what happened; can you give me an example?"

"Let's say you go to the mall with a girl and she says she's going to buy you
[some Cinnabon item I missed] and then she doesn't?"

At this point his companion to his left looks at him and lets out this sigh that
says "are you freaking kidding me right now?"

I pick up on it and say "are you referring to them?" I said, gesturing to the
girl to his left.

"Yes."

"Well when she came over she had both hands full and there are three of you."

"Yes, thank you!" she says.

"You could have offered to help her carry", I continued, "or, when she got back
and you were upset about it you could have asked why she didn't get yours on the
first trip. Then she would have told you she couldn't carry them all. Either
way, there's no reason for you to be pissed off about that."
