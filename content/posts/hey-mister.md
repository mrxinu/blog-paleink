I was sitting at a table with Mackenzie propped on my knee and to my left
there were a pair of young men sitting at a table. A young lady came over to
their table with treats in each hand. When she got there there wasn't a chair
for her.

"Where am I supposed to sit?", she said with both hands occupied.

Pointing to a table behind him, "go get a chair..."
