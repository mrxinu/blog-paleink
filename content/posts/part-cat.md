Recently I did a [leave a like, get a fact](https://twitter.com/mrxinu/status/882622708856442880) thing on my Twitter timeline
and got 31 likes. So, I brought 31 random bits of yours truly to the thread. One of those had
to do with the fact that my sleep schedule is a little strange albeit predictable if you watch
closely enough.

I was diagnosed with sleep apnea (the worst kind) about a year ago. They decided it was
so bad that not only did I need a machine to keep me motivated to draw breath while I was
sleeping but that it had to be a "BiPAP" which they describe like this:

> BiPAP (also referred to as BPAP) stands for Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure, and is very
> similar in function and design to a CPAP machine (continuous positive airway pressure).
> Similar to a CPAP machine, A BiPAP machine is a non-invasive form of therapy for patients
> suffering from sleep apnea.

Unfortunately it also makes it difficult to sleep for more than 5-6 hours so I just stopped
fighting it. I'll usually sleep from midnight until 5-6 AM and then when my work is over for
the day I'll grab another 3 hours. It all comes out in the wash, but of course to outsiders it
looks like I'm just having a lazy old time here.

It'll vary a bit if I'm not working with a customer real-time which is often the case because
I'm writing code. So in the absence of a meeting (pre-sales, assisting someone else, etc.) I'll
usually wake around the same time (5-6 AM) and then grab a nap anywhere from 10 AM on and just
work later into the evening (or whenever inspiration hits).

So there you have it. Part cat or just... [biphasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep)?
